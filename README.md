# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-Using-Gradient-Descent

## AIM:
To write a program to implement the the Logistic Regression Using Gradient Descent.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
 1.Read the given dataset.
 
 2.Fitting the dataset into the training set and test set.
 
 3.Applying the feature scaling method.
 
 4.Fitting the logistic regression into the training set.
 
 5.Prediction of the test and result
 
 6.Making the confusion matrix 7.Visualizing the training set results

## Program:
